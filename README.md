# notepad
##### A simple note-taking app built with expressJs, sequelize-orm, pug view engine, and postgreSQL.

You can add notes, edit notes, delete notes, and search notes, basically CRUD.

To get started run the following commands: 
- ### `npm install`

- ### `npm start`

#### NB: The start script uses [nodemon](https://www.nodemon.io), which you can change of course.
